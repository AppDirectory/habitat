h2.page-body--title Setting Up a Service Group Topology

p
  | By default, Habitat places running services into a service group with a standalone 
    topology; however, Habitat also has built-in support for a leader-follower topology 
    that any application can use. This support includes performing leader election and 
    sharing those results with the rest of the services in the ring.
  
p 
  | Suppose you want to run several instances of our PostgreSQL database for high availability. 
    Start off by simply restarting your PostgreSQL service, but this time add a 
    <code>-t leader</code> flag to the <code>hab start</code> command.

code
  | hab start core/postgresql -t leader


= partial "partials/terminal" do

#success
  p 
    | As you can see by the output, in a leader-follower topology, a minimum of three 
      services must be brought up to achieve quorum. We'll show how to bring up the next 
      two and see how that changes the output of this first service in the next step.

  = partial "partials/advance_button" do
    | Next - Adding Services to an Existing Group

= partial "partials/previous_button" do
  | Back to previous step
